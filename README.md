# Updated-Phone-Number-Formatting-
The code uses the Phone Utility class written by Cameron Donnelly. 
The update is on the Object Trigger, made changes to use handler pattern and perform logic in before events rather than after events.
When you are updating data on the record that triggered the event, it is best pratice to do it in before events.
